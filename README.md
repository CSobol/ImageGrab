ImageGrab
=========

ImageGrab allows you to quickly and easily save images from websites to the server of your choice using a bookmarklet and short php script.

###Notes: 
- allow_url_fopen should be enabled in php.ini
- Will not work on sites using the HTTPS protocol

####Todo:
- Move all of the styles into a stylesheet
- Add history so one can click bookmarklet and see past images he/she had saved. Probably use a text file.
